# onStart

`fun onStart(): Unit`

Overrides [RobotLifecycle.onStart](../../org.sertain/-robot-lifecycle/on-start.md)

Indicates that the robot is being enabled. This method will be called once before the
robot becomes enabled in either the teleoperated or autonomous mode. This would be a good
time to perform actions to prepare the robot for movement.
