# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Sertain! Many frameworks for FRC programming die 
off after a few years when all the active maintainers graduate the program and move on to college
and new projects, but Sertain's goal is to avoid this by having a huge team of active developers.
Even if you have little or no experience with Java or Kotlin, we would all love to help you out! 
Feel free to take on any issue or feature request, and open a pull request for it!

## Gitter

Please don't hesitate to join our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/Sertain)! Technical points of 
discussion, general questions and suggestions or anything at all, really - we would love to chat 
about it.

## Issues

improved), feel free to open up an issue as well!

If you want to open a PR that fixes a bug or adds a feature, then we can't thank you enough! It is
definitely appreciated if an issue has been created before-hand so it can be discussed first.
